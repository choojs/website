subtitle: a 4kb framework for creating sturdy frontend applications
----
text:

Choo is a framework for folks like you & me. Perhaps you're most comfortable writing HTML & CSS and just need a little JavaScript. Perhaps you're an industry veteran who wants to create reusable browser elements.

Maybe you're neither; Choo's got you too ✌

features:
  - title: Super minimal
    text: Choo's modular core was engineered from the ground up to be smaller and more efficient than every other alternative out there. This was made possible by building out the core components over the span of 3 years and combining them under a tiny API.
  - title: Easy to begin
    text: We think learning frameworks is boring. So instead of inventing a new language, Choo relies on vanilla JS and HTML. Combined with its small API and clean architecture this means Choo is easy to get started with, and stays that way as projects grow in scope and humans.
